An AI-powered healthcare platform that offers **voice-based diagnosis**, **imaging AI for medical scans**, and **OCR report analysis**.  
It integrates **LLama models**, **ElevenLabs**, **gTTS**, **OCR (Tesseract)**, and **medical image segmentation** to support early disease detection like **lung cancer** and **breast cancer**.

## ✨ Features

- 🎤 **Voice-Based Diagnosis**  
  Users provide voice inputs via ElevenLabs and gTTS. The input is processed by a LLaMA-based model to generate medical diagnostic insights.

- 🧠 **Imaging AI**  
  Image segmentation on **CT scans** and **MRI scans** for detecting abnormalities (lung cancer, breast cancer, etc.).

- 📄 **Report Reader AI**  
  OCR-powered system (using **PyTesseract**) to extract and interpret text from medical reports for automated analysis.

- 🩻 **Multimodal Output**  
  Produces diagnostic results from voice input, imaging scans, and report readings.

## 📋 Usage

1. **Voice Diagnosis**

   - Run the voice diagnosis module:
     ```bash
     python voice_diagnosis.py
     ```
   - Speak or input your symptoms.  
   - The system will process and provide a medical assessment.

2. **Imaging AI (CT/MRI Segmentation)**

   - Run the imaging analysis:
     ```bash
     python imaging_ai.py --image path_to_scan.jpg
     ```

3. **Report Reader AI**

   - Analyze medical reports:
     ```bash
     python report_reader.py --report path_to_report.pdf
     ```
